# NBG Gravestone Pipeline

## About

This project was made in conjuction with Providence's North Burial Ground and Dr. Jordi Rivera.  

Providenceâ€™s Northern Burial Ground (NBG) is unique in its size (100,000+) and longevity (in use since 1700). It contains valuable historical information about a large number of people who have lived and died in Providence. NBG is interested in telling the stories of all groups that are buried here, especially those whose stories have been historically ignored, altered, or undershared. Since NBG did not normalize data collection until 1848, one of the only ways to obtain important anthropological information is through the gravestones themselves, which are degrading due to weathering. This project aims to gather this anthropological information faster and more generally via a data science pipeline that is able to transcribe the textual and graphical information about the gravestone.
